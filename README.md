## Instructions

The project starter has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the project on the Landing Page. You will have to convert this project from a static to an interactive one. This will require modification of the HTML and CSS files, but mostly of the JavaScript file.
Open 'js / app.js' to start, and start building up the functionality of the app


## Implementation

This highlights active sections in view and relevant links while scrolling.
When scrolling up / down below the first screen a floating button to seamlessly scroll to the top of the page becomes available.
When scrolling, the navigation bar is covered, and reappears when the user finishes scrolling.
Smooth scrooling with offset compensation for the sticky navigation bar is enabled at each section.


## Running
To launch this website, simply clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in the browser.
